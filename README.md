# NOCS_PyTorch
NOCS reimplementation using PyTorch

DeepRob Course Project

I am using Python 3.8 for this project

I added a requirment.txt file so that version control becomes easier. This environment contains some bloatware, however having same environment seems important.

Use this to replicate the conda environemnt using-

conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
